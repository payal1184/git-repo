# üåê 3-Tier Architecture on AWS

This repository showcases the deployment of a **Three-Tier Architecture** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** to achieve **scalability**, **security**, and **high availability**.  
The implementation demonstrates how cloud resources can be organized into three independent tiers ‚Äî **Presentation**, **Application**, and **Database** ‚Äî ensuring better **performance**, **modularity**, and **fault tolerance** across the system.

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Presentation Layer (Frontend)

1. Launch an EC2 instance in the Public Subnet.  
2. Install Apache/Nginx web server.  
3. Deploy HTML/PHP web pages.

- **VPC & Subnet:**  
  Shows the VPC and public subnet where the web servers are deployed.  
  The VPC provides network isolation, while the Subnet organizes resources within the VPC for better traffic management.

- **Internet Gateway:**  
  The subnets allow incoming traffic from the Internet via the Internet Gateway.  
  Displays the Internet Gateway attached to the VPC, enabling public access to the web tier.

- **Route Table:**  
  Illustrates the route table associated with the public subnet, directing traffic to the Internet Gateway.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Application Layer (Backend /Business Logic Tier)

**Security Group :**  
  Configure the security group to allow HTTP traffic from the Web Layer only.

- **NAT Gateway:**  
  Configure the NAT Gateway in the public subnet to allow private instances in the Application Layer to access the Internet for updates or patches.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Database Layer (Data Tier)

- **RDS Instance:**  

  Uses Amazon RDS (MySQL/PostgreSQL) or Amazon Aurora.
  Shows the database instance deployed in the private subnet of the Database Layer.  
  The instance uses [MySQL/PostgreSQL/etc.] engine, with storage and security configured for high availability.

- **DB Subnet Group:**  
  Shows the subnet group where the database instances are deployed.  
  The DB Subnet Group contains multiple private subnets across different Availability Zones (AZs) to ensure high availability.  
  It isolates the database instances from the public internet, allowing access only from the Application Layer instances via their security groups.

## ‚ö° Deployment Steps

1. Launch Web EC2 in Public Subnet.  
2. Install Apache/Nginx.  
3. Deploy HTML/PHP pages.  
4. Launch App EC2 in Private Subnet.  
5. Allow HTTP from Web Layer in SG.  
6. Configure NAT Gateway for App EC2.  
7. Launch RDS in Private Subnet.  
8. Allow DB access from App Layer only.  
9. Test Web ‚Üí App ‚Üí DB connectivity.



## Technologies Used

- **AWS:** EC2, VPC, Subnets, Security Groups, RDS,ELB,Auto scalling group.
- **Web:** Nginx, HTML, PHP  
- **Database:** MySQL 

---

## Outcome

- Secure and scalable **3-layer architecture**.  
- Layer-wise isolation of **Web, Application, and Database tiers**.  
- Easy to deploy for **learning and testing**.
